# Step one: find a data visualization
The visualization and data I found are as below.

Title: [What Electricity Sources Power the World?](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/electricity-sources-by-fuel-in-2022/)

Data Source page: [https://www.visualcapitalist.com/electricity-sources-by-fuel-in-2022/](https://www.energyinst.org/statistical-review)

-> Data file: Statistical Review of World Energy Data: [Link to Excel data download](https://www.energyinst.org/__data/assets/excel_doc/0007/1055545/EI-stats-review-all-data.xlsx)


# Step two: critique the data visualization

## The facts I'd like to mention about this diagram

- The diagram lacks clarity on whether the changes are based on percentages or absolute values(it shows actually absolute values)

- The total electricity production in 2022 increased by 2.3% compared to 2021, which isn't highlighted in the visualization

- In its current broken pie chart, it's challenging to discern the exact percentages. For instance, the section representing renewable energy is labeled as 14.4%. However, upon quick calculation, the actual area of the circle seems to represent only 9.8%

## The consideration and critique of this diagram

- As pointed out above, it appears as though they might be emphasizing the need for cleaner energy sources by making traditional energy sources appear larger than they are

- The visualization is comprehensible for those lacking a critical eye for diagrams, however, we cannot distinguish between Natural gas, Hydroelectric, and wind as they are similar pictures

- Based on the visualization, one might perceive a smaller representation of renewable energy and a larger emphasis on coal and natural gas, with nuclear energy appearing to be on a declining trend

- If the creator's primary intent was to highlight changes, a bar chart would have been more appropriate

- If the goal was to showcase percentages, a simple pie chart would be the optimal choice

- It seems the creator prioritized aesthetics over clarity, but there are alternative ways to present the data attractively, such as integrating visuals into a bar chart. Overall, the current presentation raises some doubts about its intent

- The immediate takeaway for many would likely be, "We are still predominantly using traditional energy sources for electricity." This would be followed by a sentiment that there's a pressing need to transition to renewable energy

- Based on the discussion above, I believe the author wants to lead and cultivate the atmosphere that we need to increase the percentage of renewable energy. In this case, it would be better if we highlight the renewable energy part mainly


# Step three: sketch out a solution
