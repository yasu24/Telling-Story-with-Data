## Outline
### A high-level summary of your project

Although it took a long time I am still wondering if I can provide any good information on the topic, but I would like to discuss the "Gun ownership ratio".
In this project, I would like to find any insight based on crime, regulation, or possibly economic data.
My purpose of the project is to reduce gun violence and victims, therefore the target audience is assumed to be government people.

### A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.

As far as researched so far, I gathered some data such as,
- Gun Death Ratio per 100k people
- Regulation ranking and points including a waiting period
- Mass shooting data

I want to focus on which regulation would effectively reduce gun violence. I am focusing on the gun waiting period, but more beneficial indicators could be found through the project.

## Method and medium

My approach is to find the correlation between data using Tableau.

To find any insights to help reduce gun incidents, I would like to I will search for more data that indicates an effective approach.
