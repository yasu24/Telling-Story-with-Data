The main story is "What kind of regulation we need to enhance and add in order to reduce the number of victims of gun violence".
The catch copy will be "Teaching is much more useful than alcohol restrictions".
Firstly, I described the current situation regarding gun violence restrictions what the white house thinks it needs to do, and my motivation which I'm interested in understanding about guns.
Secondly, I explained the data of recent years about the gun death ratio and how strict the regulations in each state are.
Thirdly, the analysis and correlation between these data were provided.
Lastly, the recommendation and suggestion part came. 

**As-Is:** the current Data

**Gap:** Issues to resolve based on the analysis

**To-Be:** Project goal - reduce the number of victims of gun violence

**Counteractions:** Suggestion part


# Changes made since Part II
> Include a few paragraphs that reflect on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part 3         | **What I have changed in Part 3**           |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Some participants found it challenging to understand using the Shorthand version. | Transition to GitHub Story Format for better clarity. | Created a new shorthand and changed it to be aligned with the GitHub story. |
| Bold characters in Shorthand seem ineffective in capturing the audience's attention. | Reevaluate bold characters in Shorthand and consider enhancing them. | To highlight some parts, I put pink color with bold or underline. |
| Disconnect between the message's clarity and the context for some participants. | Strengthen the context supporting presented facts and messages. | I made a story more solid, by clarifying what the story, context, and main messages are. |
| The shorthand version felt too brief for comprehensive understanding. | Extend Shorthand content or provide supplementary material. | Same as the second point, I added a full story regarding GitHub. |
| Color usage inconsistency in the presentation. | Refine and ensure a consistent color scheme throughout the presentation. | To be coherent, I changed the color to be dark overall. Only the backgrounds of the graphs were kept white to emphasize it. | 
| Issues with visualization, like cut-off graphs. | Optimize all visualizations to ensure they're displayed appropriately. | I used pictures(jpeg) and managed to focus point on Shorthand, then full pictures can be shown. |
| The story's order might not be optimal for some participants. | Revise the narrative structure or flow for better coherence. | Story order became logically correct and more user-friendly. |
