# Final Project Part 3

# The final data story

The main story is "What kind of regulation we need to enhance and add in order to reduce the number of victims of gun violence".
The catch copy will be "Teaching is much more useful than alcohol restrictions".
Firstly, I described the current situation regarding gun violence restrictions what the white house thinks it needs to do, and my motivation which I'm interested in understanding about guns.
Secondly, I explained the data of recent years about the gun death ratio and how strict the regulations in each state are.
Thirdly, the analysis and correlation between these data were provided.
Lastly, the recommendation and suggestion part came. 

### [Basic Structure]

**As-Is:** the current Data

**Gap:** Issues to resolve based on the analysis

**To-Be:** Project goal - reduce the number of victims of gun violence

**Counteractions:** Suggestion part


# Changes made since Part II
> Include a few paragraphs that reflect on changes you made since the completion of Part II. 

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part 3         | **What I have changed in Part 3**           |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Some participants found it challenging to understand using the Shorthand version. | Transition to GitHub Story Format for better clarity. | Created a new shorthand and changed it to be aligned with the GitHub story. |
| Bold characters in Shorthand seem ineffective in capturing the audience's attention. | Reevaluate bold characters in Shorthand and consider enhancing them. | To highlight some parts, I put pink color with bold or underline. |
| Disconnect between the message's clarity and the context for some participants. | Strengthen the context supporting presented facts and messages. | I made a story more solid, by clarifying what the story, context, and main messages are. |
| The shorthand version felt too brief for comprehensive understanding. | Extend Shorthand content or provide supplementary material. | Same as the second point, I added a full story regarding GitHub. |
| Color usage inconsistency in the presentation. | Refine and ensure a consistent color scheme throughout the presentation. | To be coherent, I changed the color to be dark overall. Only the backgrounds of the graphs were kept white to emphasize it. | 
| Issues with visualization, like cut-off graphs. | Optimize all visualizations to ensure they're displayed appropriately. | I used pictures(jpeg) and managed to focus point on Shorthand, then full pictures can be shown. |
| The story's order might not be optimal for some participants. | Revise the narrative structure or flow for better coherence. | Story order became logically correct and more user-friendly. |


## The audience

**Assumed Audience**

The assumed audience is general American people who have an interest in gun regulation or visitors from all other countries, particularly the country where guns are not commonly used. 

**Assumed NOT Audience**

Any people who want to promote guns for any reason, such as industry, economy, etc. This message is not convincing people, just providing insights, therefore, these people are not in the scope of this project.

## Final design decisions

The first thing I wanted to keep in mind was "to be simplified", both logically and visually. 

In part 2, I made the short version of my story, but it was hard to understand for my audience as this was "not condensed information", but "just a lack of information". 

Also, to understand smoothly, I highlighted some sentences with pink color, which could be helpful for the audience because they can only focus on the parts.

## References

I haven't changed the dataset from part 1, respectively, I haven't changed the citation and added it in shorthand as well.

# Final thoughts

Overall, this project was a great opportunity for me to learn how to create a presentation, incorporating feedback from a test audience.

Utilizing tools such as Shorthand and Tableau, among others, proved beneficial for honing my future skills in data visualization.

I wonder if my presentation can be improved further to simplify and extract the essence of the message.

Perhaps my theme was too broad to be presented in 1 minute, so specifying the topic further could have been a viable solution.

While I only utilized a linear approximation(simple calculation) for this project, exploring machine learning approaches could have led to more complex findings. 

Although this might have made the presentation more challenging, I would like to consider a more complex theme as I am likely to explore it in the future.

Furthermore, I need to consider how to logically break down complex topics into more manageable components.

These skills and insights obtained in the class were precious to me. 

Therefore, I appreciate the professor and the opportunity to participate in the class.
